Just because you can't understand their sense of logic doesn't mean they don't have one; it's simply so different from yours that you'll have a hard time getting it. Your partner is actually quite a creative person, as you'll find if you can greet their ideas with respect rather than anxiety. Rather than trying to control the ways in which they perceive the world and interact with it, you should try to learn something from this unique perspective of theirs. If you do try to exert logic and control over them, you'll just find that they slip through your grasp anyway; but if you simply do the work of being yourself and allow them to be the person that they are as well, you'll find that you're both able to blend your styles and learn from each other. The best that can come from this connection will be an increased sense of creativity on your side, and a greater understanding of practical matters on your partner's.",
      "You tried to rely on this person in another lifetime, and they let you down in a big way. Whether they were your lover, your parent or your fellow warrior, when you needed them most, they weren't there for you, and that experience left a scar on your soul. In this life, your subconscious mind remembers that experience, and it will do anything to prevent the same thing from happening again.",
      "Especially if you've conducted your life in a somewhat haphazard way, this relationship could help you to focus on your path and become more settled within yourself. Your contribution to the relationship will be one of energy and spirit, which will help your partner stay lighthearted instead of getting bogged down in the minutiae of everyday life. Good communication between you will help you both to keep moving forward and stay on track in your lives, moving steadily toward your goals. This aspect will also help in terms of building an enduring relationship that is lastingly beneficial for both of you. With a bond like this one, in fact, you could just as easily go into business together as keep this a purely romantic relationship, because it helps you work harder and more efficiently, as a team, and stay focused on the task at hand.",
      "While your bond with this person will be strengthened by a powerful and enduring past-life connection that you share, it won't make for a fun, romantic affair. There's a good chance that if you become romantically involved, it will last long-term; after all, you're coming from a relationship in another lifetime that persevered through hard times as well as good ones, and has extended to the present life. A sense of mutual responsibility will pervade your connection now, as a result of this past-life relationship, and you'll both sense this from the start.",

You'll send out disapproving signals which your buddy will pick up immediately.

Together you'll blast away whatever stands in your way and come through unscathed on the other side. This strength and determination could be put to good use in a variety of ways. You'll meet problems creatively and head-on, which will be a great influence for your friendship  but it could also be turned outward, for the good of the rest of the world. Any humanitarian urges that you two might share will find action through this aspect's influence. Your deepest spiritual beliefs could also find expression in this friendship. Basically, what you choose to do is up to the two of you. You'll work as a creative team, and together you could move mountains!",
